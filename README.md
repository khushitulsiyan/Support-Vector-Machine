The SVM algorithm offers a choice of kernel functions for performing its processing. Basically, mapping data into a higher dimensional space is called kernelling. The mathematical function used for the transformation is known as the kernel function, and can be of different types, such as:

1.Linear

2.Polynomial

3.Radial basis function (RBF)

4.Sigmoid

Each of these functions has its characteristics, its pros and cons, and its equation, but as there's no easy way of knowing which function performs best with any given dataset. We usually choose different functions in turn and compare the results.
